This is a project that I made for the Tech Fair a couple of years ago. I made this as a website for peers to share
information through blogs and direct messages.

If you want to test out the website, do the following
1. Download MAMP(for macs not sure about windoes) or some local host provider
2. Download the folder contents
3. Place the folder contents under the htdocs in the application in the MAMP application(should be through the files)
4. type http://localhost:8888/tech_fair_project/ into a browser and explore
   NOTE this will create a database on your computer that will save and hold information such as login and credentials
